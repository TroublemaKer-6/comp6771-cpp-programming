***Difference between using `ptrdiff_t` and `int`  when do member type definition:***

### **`std::ptrdiff_t`**

•	**Definition**: `std::ptrdiff_t` is a signed integer type used to represent the difference between two pointers.

•	**Purpose**: It is specifically designed for this purpose and is guaranteed to be large enough to hold the difference between any two pointers in the address space.

•	**Portability**: It is portable and adheres to the standard, ensuring that your code will work correctly across different platforms and architectures.

•	**Range**: The range of `std::ptrdiff_t` is implementation-defined but it is typically the same as long or long long, providing a large range to handle differences even in very large data structures.

### **`int`**

•	**Definition**: int is a general-purpose signed integer type.

•	**Purpose**: It is not specifically designed for pointer arithmetic or representing differences between iterators, but can be used if the range of differences is known to be small.

•	**Portability**: While int is also portable, its size is only guaranteed to be at least 16 bits. On most modern systems, it is 32 bits.

•	**Range**: The range of int may be insufficient for very large data structures, especially if the difference between iterators could exceed the maximum value of int.

### **Key Differences**

1.	**Range**: `std::ptrdiff_t` typically has a larger range compared to int. This is important when working with large data structures where the difference between two iterators might exceed the maximum value that an int can hold.

2.	**Purpose**: `std::ptrdiff_t` is specifically designed for pointer arithmetic, ensuring that it is the most appropriate type for iterator differences.

3.	**Portability and Standards Compliance**: Using `std::ptrdiff_t` ensures that your code adheres to the C++ standard and will be portable across different platforms and architectures.

```cpp
using iterator_category = std::bidirectional_iterator_tag;
using value_type = char;
using reference = const value_type&;
using pointer = void;
using difference_type = std::ptrdiff_t; // This is preferred
```
